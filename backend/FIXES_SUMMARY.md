# Customer Data Issues - Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. New Customers Have Existing Quotations and Orders
**Problem**: New customers were seeing quotations and orders that didn't belong to them.

**Root Cause**: The backend controllers weren't filtering data based on customer authentication/authorization.

**Solution**: 
- Added customer role-based data filtering in all relevant controllers
- Implemented proper data isolation for customer users
- Added orphaned data cleanup functionality

### 2. Quotation Acceptance Error from Customer Portal
**Problem**: Customers were getting errors when trying to accept quotations from the customer portal.

**Root Cause**: Insufficient error handling and validation in quotation acceptance flow.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced error handling with specific error messages
- Added proper validation for quotation ID format
- Improved business logic checks (status, expiration, etc.)
- Added inventory availability warnings
- Better error reporting for different failure scenarios

### 3. Registration Shows "Email Already Exists" But Creates Account
**Problem**: When registering, accounts were created successfully but showed "email already exists" error.

**Root Cause**: Both User and Customer models have unique email constraints. When staff pre-creates a customer, registration fails on Customer creation even though User was created.

**Solution**:
- Implemented sequential registration process with cleanup for standalone MongoDB
- Smart customer matching: prioritizes phone number first, then email for linking
- Check for existing customers and link them to new user accounts
- Enhanced error handling with specific messages for different scenarios
- Added proper phone number and email conflict resolution
- Improved logging with detailed customer matching information
- Automatic cleanup of orphaned records on failure

## Files Modified

### Backend Controllers
1. **`backend/controllers/quotationController.js`**
   - Enhanced `acceptQuotation()` with comprehensive error handling
   - Improved `markQuotationAsViewed()` with validation
   - Enhanced `rejectQuotation()` with better status checks
   - Added customer data filtering in `getQuotations()`

2. **`backend/controllers/customerController.js`**
   - Added customer role-based filtering in `getCustomers()`

3. **`backend/controllers/orderController.js`**
   - Added customer data isolation in `getOrders()`

4. **`backend/controllers/invoiceController.js`**
   - Added customer role-based filtering in `getInvoices()`

### Database Seeding
5. **`backend/seed.js`**
   - Added `cleanupOrphanedData()` function
   - Enhanced seeding process to clean orphaned records

## Key Improvements

### 1. Customer Data Isolation
```javascript
// If user is a customer, only show their own data
if (req.user && req.user.role === 'customer') {
  filter.customer = req.user.customer || req.user._id;
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Quotation Acceptance
- **Validation**: Proper MongoDB ObjectId format checking
- **Status Checks**: Comprehensive status validation (expired, converted, already accepted/rejected)
- **Inventory Warnings**: Real-time stock availability checking
- **Error Messages**: User-friendly, specific error messages

### 3. Orphaned Data Cleanup
- Removes quotations without valid customer references
- Removes orders without valid customer references  
- Removes invoices without valid customer references
- Integrated into seeding process for clean starts

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- Specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Proper HTTP status codes (400, 404, 500)
- Validation error handling with detailed messages
- MongoDB CastError handling for invalid IDs

### 5. Enhanced Registration Flow
- **Sequential Operations**: Uses sequential saves with cleanup for standalone MongoDB compatibility
- **Smart Customer Matching**: Prioritizes phone number first, then email for finding existing customers
- **Customer Linking**: Automatically links existing customers to new user accounts
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles phone number and email conflicts gracefully
- **Enhanced Logging**: Detailed logging with customer matching method information
- **Cleanup Support**: Automatic cleanup of orphaned records on failure

### 6. Smart Customer Matching Logic
```javascript
// Priority-based customer search
// 1. First try to match by phone number (more reliable)
if (phone) {
  existingCustomer = await Customer.findOne({ phone });
}

// 2. If not found, try to match by email  
if (!existingCustomer) {
  existingCustomer = await Customer.findOne({ email });
}

// 3. Link existing customer to new user account
if (existingCustomer) {
  existingCustomer.user = user._id;
  await existingCustomer.save();
}
```

## Testing the Fixes

### 1. Test Customer Data Isolation
1. Create a new customer account
2. Login as that customer
3. Verify they only see their own quotations/orders/invoices

### 2. Test Quotation Acceptance
1. Create a quotation for a customer
2. Send the quotation
3. Try to accept it from the customer portal
4. Verify proper error messages for various scenarios:
   - Invalid quotation ID
   - Expired quotation
   - Already accepted/rejected quotation
   - Quotation not in proper status

### 3. Test Orphaned Data Prevention
1. Run the seed script: `npm run db:seed`
2. Verify no orphaned records exist
3. Check data integrity with the validation script

### 4. Test Enhanced Registration Flow
```bash
cd backend
node scripts/test-customer-registration.js
```

**Manual Testing Steps:**
1. Create a customer record via staff portal (without user account)
2. Try to register with the same email from customer portal
3. Verify account is created and linked (no error message)
4. Try to register again with same email (should show proper error)
5. Verify customer can login and see only their data

## API Endpoints Affected

### Public Routes (Customer Portal)
- `POST /api/quotations/:id/accept` - Enhanced with better validation
- `POST /api/quotations/:id/reject` - Improved error handling
- `POST /api/quotations/:id/view` - Better status management

### Protected Routes (Staff Portal)
- `GET /api/customers` - Added customer role filtering
- `GET /api/quotations` - Added customer data isolation
- `GET /api/orders` - Added customer data isolation  
- `GET /api/invoices` - Added customer data isolation

## Security Improvements

1. **Data Isolation**: Customers can only access their own data
2. **Input Validation**: Proper MongoDB ObjectId validation
3. **Status Verification**: Prevents unauthorized state changes
4. **Role-Based Access**: Proper filtering based on user roles

## Error Message Examples

Before:
```json
{ "success": false, "message": "Server error" }
```

After:
```json
{
  "success": false, 
  "message": "This quotation has expired and can no longer be accepted"
}
```

## Registration Response Examples

**New Customer Registration:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Account created successfully",
  "token": "jwt_token_here",
  "user": {...},
  "customer": {
    "id": "customer_id",
    "customerCode": "CUST-001",
    "isExistingCustomer": false
  }
}
```

**Existing Customer Linked by Phone:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Account created successfully and linked to existing customer profile (matched by phone number)",
  "token": "jwt_token_here",
  "user": {...},
  "customer": {
    "id": "existing_customer_id",
    "customerCode": "CUST-002", 
    "isExistingCustomer": true,
    "linkedBy": "phone"
  }
}
```

**Existing Customer Linked by Email:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Account created successfully and linked to existing customer profile (matched by email)",
  "token": "jwt_token_here",
  "user": {...},
  "customer": {
    "id": "existing_customer_id",
    "customerCode": "CUST-003",
    "isExistingCustomer": true,
    "linkedBy": "email"
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- Added proper indexing support for customer-based queries
- Efficient aggregation queries for orphaned data detection
- Minimal performance impact from additional filtering
- Parallel cleanup operations for better performance

### 6. Customer User ID Not Visible in Database
**Problem**: After user registration, the customer record in the database didn't show the linked user ID.

**Root Cause**: The Customer schema was missing the `user` field definition to link to User records.

**Solution**:
- Added `user` field to Customer schema with proper ObjectId reference to User model
- Added index for better query performance  
- Created fix script to link existing customers to their user accounts
- Added verification logging to ensure proper linking

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/models/Customer.js`: Added user field to schema
- `backend/controllers/authController.js`: Added verification logging
- `backend/scripts/fix-customer-user-linking.js`: Script to fix existing data

**Verification**:
```javascript
// Customer schema now includes:
user: {
  type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  ref: 'User',
  default: null,
  index: true
}
```

### 7. System-Wide Customer-User Relationship Update
**Problem**: All controllers were using `req.user.customer || req.user._id` for customer filtering, which was unreliable and didn't use the proper database relationship.

**Root Cause**: Controllers were not properly utilizing the new `user` field in the Customer model for data filtering.

**Solution**:
- Updated ALL backend controllers to use `Customer.findOne({ user: req.user._id })` for proper customer lookup
- Implemented consistent error handling when customer record is not found  
- Replaced unreliable fallback logic with proper database relationships

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/controllers/customerController.js`: Updated customer filtering
- `backend/controllers/invoiceController.js`: Updated invoice filtering  
- `backend/controllers/quotationController.js`: Updated quotation filtering
- `backend/controllers/orderController.js`: Updated order filtering
- `backend/controllers/supportController.js`: Added customer role filtering for support tickets
- `backend/controllers/workshopController.js`: Added customer role filtering for workshop jobs

**Before (Problematic)**:
```javascript
if (req.user.role === 'customer') {
  filter.customer = req.user.customer || req.user._id; // Unreliable!
}
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```javascript
if (req.user.role === 'customer') {
  const customerRecord = await Customer.findOne({ user: req.user._id });
  if (customerRecord) {
    filter.customer = customerRecord._id;
  } else {
    return res.json({ success: true, data: [], pagination: {...} });
  }
}
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Audit Logging**: Track customer data access patterns
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of public quotation endpoints
3. **Real-time Notifications**: Alert when quotations are accepted/rejected
4. **Advanced Permissions**: More granular customer access control

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, the changes can be rolled back by:
1. Reverting the controller modifications
2. Removing the customer filtering logic
3. Running the original seed script
4. Restoring from database backup if needed

## Final System Status

All issues have been resolved and tested successfully. The system now properly:

1. ✅ Isolates customer data based on authentication
2. ✅ Handles quotation acceptance with proper validation
3. ✅ Manages user registration without transaction dependency  
4. ✅ Links customers to user accounts intelligently
5. ✅ Removes phone number dependency for purchase filtering
6. ✅ Properly stores and displays user ID in customer records
7. ✅ Uses consistent `Customer.findOne({ user: req.user._id })` across ALL controllers
8. ✅ Provides proper data isolation for customers in workshop, support, orders, quotations, and invoices
9. ✅ Handles POS purchases correctly in customer portal

**Controllers Updated for Proper Customer-User Relationship**:
- **Customer Controller**: Only shows own customer record
- **Invoice Controller**: Only shows own invoices/purchases (including POS)
- **Quotation Controller**: Only shows own quotations  
- **Order Controller**: Only shows own orders
- **Support Controller**: Only shows own support tickets
- **Workshop Controller**: Only shows own workshop jobs

## Support and Maintenance

- Monitor error logs for any new issues
- Run the validation script periodically to check data integrity
- Keep the cleanup script for future maintenance
- Update documentation as new features are added
- The codebase is now more robust, consistent, and provides a secure, properly isolated user experience across all customer-facing features
